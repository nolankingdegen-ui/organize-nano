# Template App 53 — AI Agent & Engineer Guide
You are using this app template (pre-cloned into `/home/user/workspace`) to build out the user's requested app. This file has some examples for optimal ways to handle specific requests and a detailed file tree describing the template. Do not edit this file.

This repository includes a production-ready Expo + React Native template designed for AI agents and engineers to rapidly build high-quality mobile apps in the [Vibecode](https://vibecodeapp.com) mobile app and website. This guide explains how the template is set up, the technical decisions behind it, best practices, and the first steps you should take after the initial prompt.

If you are an AI engineer (human or agent), please read the whole file carefully before making changes.


## Stack and key decisions
- Expo SDK 53, React Native 0.79.2, React 19.0.0.
- Navigation: React Navigation 7
  - `@react-navigation/native-stack` for native-feeling stacks and `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` for tabs.
  - Example Router is implemented in `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` with a root stack and a tab navigator as an example.
  - You must edit the navigator after the first prompt from the user. Remove all unused tabs from the navigator and their corresponding screen files in `src/screens/`
  — DO NOT leave empty or placeholder tabs/screens when you edit the navigator.
  - For Games and full screen app experiences, remove the tab navigator entirely. You may also want to remove the header and back button. You will be punished if the user sees any existing placeholder tab and page.
  - Please either create at least 2 fully functional tabs with real content, or remove the tab navigator. Never create apps with 1 tab or empty tabs. When removing tabs, also remove the unused screen files.
  - Don't customize insets in tabs and header. That means no SafeAreaView or useSafeAreaInsets in screens that are tabs or use default react navigation header.
- TypeScript with strict mode
  - Path alias `@/*` configured in `tsconfig.json` for clean imports.
  - Follow strict typing and avoid `any`. Use the TypeScript LSP and ESLint to help you write correct code with proper types.
- Styling: Nativewind (Tailwind) + Tailwind Merge
  - Global Tailwind is imported in `index.ts` via `global.css`.
  - Prefer `className` for `Text` and `View`; use `StyleSheet` for FlatList/Animated/complex components.
- Gestures & animations
  - `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated@3` are preconfigured.
- Icons: Use `lucide-react-native` for all icons
- State management
  - Zustand + optional AsyncStorage persistence. Place stores in `src/state`. Persist minimally.

## Environment and constraints (Vibecode)
- Dev Expo server is managed automatically (port 8081). Do not check, change, or restart it; if preview issues occur, ask the user to click the refresh button or pull to refresh within the Vibecode app.
- Backend is running on port 3000 automatically. Do not check, change, or restart it. 
- Do not manage git. It is done automatically.
- You can view all logs by reading the `home/user/workspace/expo.log` file. The user can view the logs in the Vibecode app.
- Use `bun` (not npm/yarn). Scripts are in `template-app-53/package.json`.
- Environment variables are injected at runtime; access via `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*` directly. Do NOT use `@env` or `expo-constants` for secrets.
- The user can add new enviroment variables using the ENV tab on the Vibecode app.

## Dependency policy: why versions are fixed
- Stability first: The template pins React Native and Expo to known-good versions that work with the included patches in `patches/` and `patchedDependencies` in `package.json`.
- Predictability for agents: Avoids unexpected native changes or autolinking inconsistencies that break the build.
- Security and review: Minimizes drift so changes are deliberate and reviewable.

### What you can install
- Allowed: JavaScript-only libraries (e.g., utilities like `lodash`, validation like `zod`, UI helpers without native modules, icon fonts, or Google font packages like `@expo/google-fonts` packages like `@expo/google-fonts/Roboto` or `@expo/google-fonts/Inter` for fonts.).
- Allowed: ANY packages in the `backend` directory.
- Avoid: New native modules or libraries that require custom native configuration. Many common native modules are already included; prefer using what is preinstalled.
- If in doubt, prefer using or extending the included modules. Do not add packages that require custom config plugins or manual native steps.

## First steps after the first prompt
1. Update navigation
   - Edit `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` to define the routes you need. Add or rename tabs and stack screens. Use `headerShown`/`headerTransparent`/`presentation` as appropriate.
2. Create screens
   - Add files in `src/screens/` using the strongly-typed helpers from `src/navigation/types.ts`. Use `Pressable` (not `TouchableOpacity`).
   - For scrollable screens with headers, use `useHeaderHeight()` and set `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"` where needed.
3. Set up state
   - Create minimal Zustand stores in `src/state`. Use individual selectors to avoid infinite loops. Persist only the necessary slices with AsyncStorage if needed.
4. Styling and theming
   - Use Tailwind classes via `className` on `Text`/`View`. Use `StyleSheet` for complex or animated components.
   - Use `lucide-react-native` for iconography.
5. Safe areas & headers
   - `App.tsx` already includes `SafeAreaProvider`. Inside screens use `View`, not `SafeAreaView`, unless you use a custom header component. Most cases you can configure headers via navigator options.
6. Keyboard safety
   - Ensure inputs are not obscured by the keyboard. Use appropriate padding/scrolling and dismiss keyboards when tapping outside.
   - Use the `KeyboardAvoidingView` or `KeyboardAvoidingScrollView` or `react-native-keyboard-controller` library to manage the keyboard.

## Commands
There are only a few scripts you will need, as the Vibecode dev Expo server is managed automatically, and the app can be previwed using the Vibecode app.
```bash
bun run typecheck    # typecheck with TypeScript
bun run lint         # lint with Expo config
bun run format       # Prettier format
```
